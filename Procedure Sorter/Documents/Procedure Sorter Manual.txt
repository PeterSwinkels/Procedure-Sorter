Procedure Sorter v1.10 - Manual, by: Peter Swinkels

Description:
Procedure Sorter is a utility that sorts procedures in BASIC program modules by their names. 

Usage:
The name of the module to process, project or project group file is specified as a command line argument.

The following command line arguments are also supported:

Argument:		Description:
/CFB			Checks whether source files are in binary format. These are skipped when detected.
/DEP			Deletes empty procedures.
/RWS			Removes whitespace at the end of lines.
/SUS			Sorts procedures with underscores in their name separately.

The following file name extensions are recognised:
Extension:	Type:
.bas		Code Module
.cls		Class Module
.ctl		User Control Module
.dob		User Document Module
.frm		Form Module
.mak		Project File
.pag		Property Page Module
.vbg		Project Group
.vbp		Project File

Procedures Types Recognised:
This program recognises event procedures, functions, methods, property procedure and subroutines. The following modifiers are recognised:
-friend
-private
-public 
-static

Notes:
Comments preceding a procedure are considered part of that procedure. This program does not expect any code outside a procedure unless it is placed before any procedure code. Multiple property procedures for the same property are sorted by whether they write or read a property value.

Warning:
Procedure Sorter cannot process files stored in a binary format (such as "QuickBasic Fast Load and Save") and will corrupt these files. Use the command line arguments to enable the detection of binary files.
